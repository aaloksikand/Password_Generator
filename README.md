# Password Generator
## Description
We have made the following additions to the password generator:
1.  We created a function called generatePassword;
2.  We asked the user what kind of characters they would like in their password (small caps, large caps, numerics, special characters);
3.  We asked the user the password length between 8 and 128 characters;
4.  We created if/then/while statements accounting for all possible scenarios;
5.  We used the "concat" method to combine strings together;
6.  We randomized the password string and returned a string value of the user's choice using the ".charAt," "Math.floor," "Math.random," and ".length" functions;
